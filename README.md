# Problem Statement
Planet With People (Sustain)

# Challenge:

To apply new methods for mapping people – our settlements, infrastructure, population, and activities – in ways that can help everyone understand and meet human needs related to disasters, climate change, public health, food, water, energy resources, and other aspects of sustainable development.
The main theme of the Planet with People problem statement is to focus on the most basic need of people during any catastrophic situation and address that problem with a sustainable solution. Keeping this theme in mind we have tried to address the most basic need of people during any catastrophic or pandemic situation reason being that Hospitals are the first place that become crowded during the an emergency situation and this situation leads to inconsistency in the flow of proceedings of the patients which inturn causes millions of deaths in India only. 
We have tried to  come up with a solution that would avoid such scenarios during an emergency situation. Thinking a lot about it we came up with a solution which would prevent such scenarios from happening in the first place. As addressed in the problem statement we found a huge amount of data which gives us information about the current scenarios of patients, their deaths and resources available for patients in the hospital. But none of the data were organised in a manner that would be useful for the user and produce a meaningful result.
The idea is to use the existing data in the hospitals regarding their location from the required patient, no of beds available, no of ambulance available etc. and use these information to provide the location of the most reasonable hospital to the patient. This location can be redirected to the google maps api and google maps can provide the reasonable route to the patient.


# Proposed Solution:

The solution to the proposed problem would be presented in the form of API which could be integrated on various platforms e:g Google Maps. In this solution, our main focus is to optimize the hospital allotments to the patients in the least possible time and manage the flow of further proceedings. This can be done by creating a database of existing hospitals with the current number of patients in them and extracting the free slots, resources and doctors of a particular hospital in an area in order to provide the user with the most reasonable hospital that would be suitable for them and there would be no waste of time in searching for a proper hospital for the patient during the emergency situation. All the required data would be collected and the user request would pass through our API which would provide them with the reasonable hospital and after registration of a patient in a particular hospital the hospital database would be updated which in turn would update the current decision of the proposed API in order to provide an optimal solution. 

Our aim would be to make this solution more real-time based and fault-tolerant.
